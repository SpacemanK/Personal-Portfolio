      <p  data-aos="fade-up"  data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-once="true" >I am Marouan ASSELMAN, a 22 year old software engineer who just graduated from Ecole Nationale Superieure de l'Informatique et d'Analyse des Systemes (ENSIAS). <br/> I fell in love with IT when I was still a kid, my father had brought home a computer before I was born, one of those old Pentium 2 models with a 
     huge old monitor. I believe I picked up a keyboard before I even picked up a pen, and it all started with electronic games. At first I was playing every game I could play, and I was always fascinated with how everything works in harmony. 22 years later, I'm pursuing a career in what I love and I am still looking forward to learning more with the same fiery passion that led me here.<br/> I started off coding some basic projects in C and later on in Python, and I've picked up quite a few skills along the way, below you'll find more details about what I can do !</p>

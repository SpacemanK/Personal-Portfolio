            This was a great learning opportunity, it was my first professional opportunity in Blockchain. I was the lead blockchain developer, where I had to build and maintain a large database of code for smart-contracts I wrote <span className="colored">(3K+ lines of code)</span>.
            Regardless of the huge workload, I was able to grow alot during this internship and got to work on a big-scale project and work further on developing my skills.

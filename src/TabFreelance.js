            <p> I've successfully completed multiple freelance projects, and this in various domains. My niche was<span className="colored">webscraping and data-science</span> ,
             but I've also worked on <span className="colored">fullstack development, Blockchain, automation, UI/UX and graphic Design, among others.</span>
            These projects taught me alot, both in technical terms and in the professional sphere.
             I was able to pick up many new technologies and stacks, and I was able to inspect closely both how companies work and individuals. Other than that, I was also able to maintain<span className="colored"> great client relationships</span>  and got to know many great people with whom I enjoyed working. Handling the relational part was to me half the work, as I found myself spending almost the same amount of time communicating with clients and coding.
